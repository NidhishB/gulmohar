### Becoming Native
The Delonix regia—or the Gulmohar, as it is called in India—is a flowering tree native to Madagascar.[^1] It blossoms every summer across villages and cities in India, and its vivid red flowers are associated strongly with the ideas of home, nostalgia, and summertime. A popular name for housing societies, residential areas, parks, restaurants, resorts, boutiques, companies, songs, a literary magazine, and an award-winning Disney+ Hotstar movie, the Gulmohar takes on many faces in India, each serving as a testament to its cultural significance.

This sense that the Gulmohar tree is entrenched in Indian culture, however, belies the fact that the plant only appeared in the subcontinent in the nineteenth century. First ‘discovered’ in 1828 in Madagascar, within a few decades, the tree made its way across the tropics through the botanical networks of the British Empire, blossoming in India and reaching as far as Jamaica and Singapore.[^2] The Gulmohar’s journey, from its introduction to India by the East India Company to its eventual cultural integration, tells a fascinating story of how botany, colonization, revolution, art, and memory aligned to root a plant in the Indian subcontinent.

### Colonial Discovery
The discovery of the Gulmohar in Madagascar reveals the intimate, transnational network of botanists who operated out of the colonies, partaking in the trade of botanical material and knowledge with their contemporaries in Europe. The tree was discovered by Wenceslas Bojer (1795–1856), a French-speaking botanist from Prague. Francis I, the Emperor of Austria, sponsored Bojer’s education and marked him “destined at a future period for missions of scientific discovery".[^3] In 1820, Bojer traveled to Mauritius, a British colony, where he lived for the rest of his life and from there undertook botanical expeditions spanning the east coast of Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean, with a focus on Madagascar.

Mauritius was a budding center of imperial botanical learning. Its past as a French colony—from 1715 until it was seized by the British in 1810—resulted in it being a site of collaboration between English and French speakers. In addition to Bojer was part of a group of botanists that included Irish botanist Charles Telfair and his wife, Anna; Mauritian botanist Louis Bouton; and D. Desjarns, all of whom were in close contact with Sir William Jackson Hooker, the first director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Centers of knowledge in the metropole acted as authorities that legitimized the findings of overseas botanists, while depending on them to discover rare plant species that would expand the Empire’s knowledge, resources, and trade.[^4] The botanists at Mauritius thus sent Hooker regular reports of their discoveries along with seeds and specimens. In exchange, they relied on Hooker to send news of scientific and botanical progress in Europe, as they felt they were “exiled from the world of knowledge.”[^5]

Prior to the invasion, it was called Isle de France, and French remains a de facto language in the country today." license="public domain">

In 1828, Charles Telfair wrote to Hooker about a plant specimen discovered by Bojer that was “worthy of a place” in his works: the _Poinciana regia_ (it would later be renamed _Delonix regia_).[^6] Bojer likely discovered the plant during his second expedition to Madagascar. Following his initial letter, Telfair sent Hooker seeds of the plant and a drawing by Bojer, hoping to get it published in _Curtis’s Botanical Magazine_, for which Hooker was its main editor.[^7]  At the time, the magazine was the largest and most renowned serial publication of its kind.

### European Fascination
In 1829, Hooker included an entry on the Poinciana regia in the magazine. The entry was accompanied by Joseph Swan’s stunning engraving of Poinciana regia flowers based on a “magnificent drawing” by Bojer.[^8] In his descriptions, Hooker mentioned that they sometimes published entries on beautiful and rare plants that the English had no hope of cultivating successfully in the country; but this, he claimed, was not the case with the Poinciana regia. He would have waited for the plant to blossom before publishing an entry on it, if it “were not the subject of such great interest”.[^9] He expressed hope “of its blossoming in this country” very soon, thanks to the attempt of Robert Barclay (a wealthy businessman and amateur botanist) to raise saplings of the seeds sent by Telfair. Barclay’s vast garden Bury Hill had been the site of many exotic plants taking root in Britain.[^10]
